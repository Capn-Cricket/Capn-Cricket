### Hi there I'm Kirk ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with a passion for aviation and building things.  For me writting code is one of the best ways to build things that can truely be useful.  Before finding code I built training programs at an airline and built and maintained sailboats.  I bring my varied experience into the code I write.  While not coding I enjoy boating, traveling, playing with my young son, and skateboarding.
